# NowPlaying
Extremely simple NET 6.0 app that can serve as a Browser Source in OBS.
Sole purpose is to show current song playing in ANY media player that uses
the Windows SDK to integrate with the media player controls

### Why?
Did not find any extension for OBS that uses `Windows.SDK.Contracts`
to get the current song. This allows me to display song that I am currently 
playing on my stream in virtually any desktop app with zero configuration.

### Download
To download the binary head over to the [releases section](https://github.com/Xseba360/NowPlaying/releases)

### Credits
Thanks to [Benjamin Summerton](https://github.com/define-private-public) for the extremely simple HttpListener snippet
